    ============= Feedback ============================

    How many hours in total did you spend on this assignment?

        Include reading time, research time, coding time, AND test/debug time.

            ~ 24 hrs


    What did I learn?

        I was able to make more connections to how the mvc model works.
        And get a better understanding on the flow through
        the View, ModelProxy, ViewProxy, and Model.

    What was easy about this assignment?

        The concepts of using proxies to communicate with the view and model
        once I thought about it for a little bit.

    What gave you trouble? Describe specific problems, you had, if any.

        I had a little trouble with the client sockets causing the server to
        close when they disconnected. Also when I caught and ignored the
        socket exceptions inside the server loop the resources did not get released.

    What can the instructor do to improve this assignment?

        The write up was unclear about a few things
        e.g. how the error message to the client should be displayed
        and if it should be displayed to err or out.
        and when the user is quitting it seems odd to display
        the your turn prompt again as shown in the transcripts.

    Would you have liked to add or do anything further?

        I would have liked to be able to adjust the output to the client.
        There were a few cases that confused me about how the server was
        supposed to handle the request and respond. such as when the player
        selects new game why the server says "start game" and "restarting game"
        instead of just "restarting game".
